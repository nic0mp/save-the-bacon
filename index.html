				<p>Hello all, welcome to Save The Bacon! We at Save The Bacon are here to show our dedication of how much we love our swine. We enjoyed the salty, sweet, and moistful taste that is blissful for our mouths. But most importantly, we at Save The Bacon are here to fight against those unrightful vegans. Many vegans have criticized us for our admiration of bacon and they are trying to take away our right to eat our delicious pork. They've been contacting the U.S. Department of Health in order to ban bacon. We must put an end to this. With your help by donating money, we can march to Washington D.C. and tell them that you can't take away our pig. </p>
